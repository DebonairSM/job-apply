# Job Description Keyword Highlighting

## Overview

Add inline keyword highlighting to the job description panel:

- **Green**: Perfect matches (keywords in profile mustHave/preferred lists that match the job)
- **Red**: Prohibitive requirements (blockers from AI ranking that indicate poor fit)

## Implementation Strategy

Use existing data from the ranking system:

- `must_haves` field (JSON string) - contains keywords the AI found that match profile requirements
- `blockers` field (JSON string) - contains prohibitive requirements identified by AI
- `missing_keywords` field (JSON string) - keywords the profile needs but job lacks

These fields are already populated during the search/ranking phase and stored in the database.

## Changes Required

### 1. Update JobDescriptionPanel Component

File: `src/dashboard/client/components/JobDescriptionPanel.tsx`

Add:

- Parse `must_haves` and `blockers` from job data
- Create text highlighting function that marks keywords inline
- Apply green background to must_haves matches
- Apply red background to blocker keywords
- Keep original text readable with proper contrast

### 2. Update Job Type Interface

File: `src/dashboard/client/lib/types.ts`

Already has the fields we need:

- `must_haves?: string`
- `blockers?: string`
- `missing_keywords?: string`

### 3. Update JobsList to Pass Full Job Data

File: `src/dashboard/client/components/JobsList.tsx`

Modify to pass complete job object (including must_haves, blockers) to the description panel instead of just title/company/description.

## Technical Approach

1. Parse JSON strings from database fields into arrays
2. Create a text processing function that:

- Splits description into words/phrases
- Matches against green keywords (case-insensitive)
- Matches against red keywords (case-insensitive)
- Wraps matches in `<mark>` tags with appropriate CSS classes

3. Render highlighted HTML safely using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or a sanitized approach
4. Style with Tailwind classes for green/red backgrounds

## Color Scheme

- Green highlights: `bg-green-200` with `text-green-900` for good contrast
- Red highlights: `bg-red-200` with `text-red-900` for clear warning

### To-dos

- [ ] Verify Job interface has must_haves, blockers, missing_keywords fields
- [ ] Create text highlighting utility function that marks keywords inline
- [ ] Update JobsList to pass full job object to JobDescriptionPanel
- [ ] Update JobDescriptionPanel to parse and highlight keywords in description
- [ ] Test highlighting with real job data in dashboard
