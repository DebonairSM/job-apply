# AI Job Application Assistant

**Intelligent job search automation that learns, adapts, and applies for you.**

Transform your job search from hours of manual work into minutes of intelligent automation. This system finds the right opportunities, blocks companies you don't want, and applies with personalized responses - all powered by local AI that protects your privacy.

## What It Does

**üéØ Smart Job Discovery**  
Searches LinkedIn with profile-specific queries, finds jobs that match your expertise, and queues high-scoring opportunities automatically.

**üß† Intelligent Ranking**  
AI evaluates each job across 9 categories (Azure, Security, .NET, Performance, etc.) using weighted scoring that adapts to your preferences and learns from rejections.

**üö´ Company & Tech Filtering**  
Block unwanted companies and filter out jobs with technologies outside your stack before they're even ranked.

**ü§ñ Automated Applications**  
Fills application forms intelligently across different job boards (LinkedIn, Greenhouse, Lever, Workday) with AI-generated, personalized responses.

**üìä Live Dashboard**  
Monitor everything in real-time with statistics, job lists, activity logs, and learning insights that update automatically.

**üîÑ Continuous Learning**  
System learns from every rejection, automatically adjusting weights and building filters to avoid similar jobs in the future.

## Quick Start

**Daily Workflow**
```bash
npm run search -- --profile core    # Find jobs matching your core skills
npm run apply -- --easy             # Apply to Easy Apply positions  
npm run dashboard:dev                # Monitor progress at https://localhost:3000
```

**Block Unwanted Companies**
```bash
npm run block:company "CompanyName" # Never see jobs from this company again
npm run filters:list                # View all active blocks and filters
```

**Technology Filtering**
```bash
npm run filters:add                 # Block Go, Java, Python-focused roles
npm run filters:remove              # Clear technology filters
```

## How It Works

**Search Profiles**  
Choose from 8 pre-configured search profiles, each with tailored Boolean queries and scoring weights:
- `core` - Azure API Engineer roles
- `security` - Security-focused positions  
- `performance` - Performance optimization roles
- `devops` - DevOps and infrastructure
- `core-net` - Pure .NET development
- `legacy-modernization` - Legacy system upgrades
- `backend` - General backend development
- `event-driven` - Event-driven architecture

**Intelligent Scoring**  
Jobs are evaluated across 9 weighted categories. The same job scores differently depending on which profile found it - a security job ranks security skills higher, while a performance job emphasizes optimization expertise.

**Adaptive Learning**  
Every rejection teaches the system:
- "Too junior" ‚Üí increases seniority requirements
- "Wrong tech stack" ‚Üí blocks similar technologies  
- Multiple company rejections ‚Üí adds company to blocklist
- Location issues ‚Üí filters non-remote positions

**Smart Applications**  
AI generates personalized responses using your profile and resume context. Forms are filled intelligently with automatic ATS detection and field mapping that improves over time.
