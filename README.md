## What It Does

**ðŸŽ¯ Smart Job Discovery**  
Searches LinkedIn with profile-specific queries, finds jobs that match your expertise, and queues high-scoring opportunities automatically.

**ðŸ§  Intelligent Ranking**  
AI evaluates each job across 9 categories (Azure, Security, .NET, Performance, etc.) using weighted scoring that adapts to your preferences and learns from rejections.

**ðŸš« Company & Tech Filtering**  
Block unwanted companies and filter out jobs with technologies outside your stack before they're even ranked.

**ðŸ¤– Automated Applications**  
Fills application forms intelligently across different job boards (LinkedIn, Greenhouse, Lever, Workday) with AI-generated, personalized responses.

**ðŸ“Š Live Dashboard**  
Monitor everything in real-time with statistics, job lists, activity logs, and learning insights that update automatically.

**ðŸ”„ Continuous Learning**  
System learns from every rejection, automatically adjusting weights and building filters to avoid similar jobs in the future.

## How It Works

**Search Profiles**  
Choose from 13 pre-configured profiles with tailored Boolean searches and smart scoring.

Want to create your own profile? See [`docs/PROFILE_CREATION_GUIDE.md`](docs/PROFILE_CREATION_GUIDE.md) for the complete process.

| Profile | Focus | Best For |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `core` | Azure API Engineer | Cloud-native full-time roles |
| `contract` | Contract .NET Developer | Freelance/contract positions |
| `core-net` | Pure .NET | Traditional .NET development |
| `security` | Security Engineer | Auth, governance, API security |
| `performance` | Performance Engineer | Optimization and reliability |
| `backend` | Backend Developer | General backend work |
| `event-driven` | Integration Engineer | Messaging and events |
| `devops` | DevOps Developer | CI/CD and automation |
| `legacy-modernization` | Modernization | Legacy system upgrades |
| `aspnet-simple` | ASP.NET (Simple) | Basic ASP.NET keyword search |
| `csharp-azure-no-frontend` | C# + Azure | Backend roles without Angular/React |
| `az204-csharp` | AZ-204 + C# | Azure Developer Associate certification roles |
| `ai-enhanced-net` | AI-Enhanced .NET | AI-assisted development with Cursor, Copilot, LangChain |

**Smart Scoring**  
Jobs score differently based on which profile finds them. Security profile emphasizes auth/governance, performance profile focuses on optimization, contract profile targets freelance keywords.

**Learns From Rejections**  
- "Too junior" â†’ filters entry-level jobs
- "Wrong tech" â†’ blocks similar technologies  
- Multiple rejections â†’ blocklists company
- Location mismatch â†’ filters non-remote

**Auto-Apply**  
Generates personalized responses using your resume. Handles LinkedIn Easy Apply, Greenhouse, Lever, and Workday forms with intelligent field mapping.

Update statuses as you hear back to help the learning system improve.
