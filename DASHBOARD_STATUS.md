- ✅ Pagination and filtering support

#### Frontend (React + Vite)
- ✅ React application with TypeScript

- ✅ TanStack Query for data fetching
- ✅ Tailwind CSS for styling
- ✅ Auto-refresh every 5 seconds

#### Components
- ✅ Dashboard Overview - Statistics cards and recent activity
- ✅ Jobs List - Sortable table with filtering
- ✅ Activity Log - Run history with details
- ✅ Navigation - Tab-based routing between views

### Testing - ALL TESTS PASSED ✅

The dashboard has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Backend server starts successfully on port 3001
- ✅ Health endpoint responding (200 OK)
- ✅ Stats endpoint returning correct job statistics (19 reported jobs)
- ✅ Jobs endpoint with pagination working (tested with limit=3)
- ✅ Runs endpoint returning activity history (5 runs found)
- ✅ Frontend dev server runs on port 3000 (200 OK)
- ✅ React application loading with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ CORS configured properly
- ✅ Vite proxy working for API calls
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Tailwind CSS v3 configured correctly with .cjs files
- ✅ PostCSS compatible with ES modules

**See `PHASE_A_TEST_REPORT.md` for detailed test results and API responses.**

### Notes

- Dashboard runs independently from CLI automation
- Uses shared SQLite database for real-time monitoring
- Polling interval set to 5 seconds for updates
- Backend and frontend can run separately if needed
- Production build creates static files served by Express
