# Apply Filter - Before vs After

## BEFORE (The Problem)

**Page Load:**
```
☐ Easy Apply only
☐ External ATS only
☐ Dry run
```

**User clicks Start without checking any boxes:**
```bash
[Apply Command] Options received: {"easy":false,"external":false,"dryRun":false}
[Apply Command] Mode: All queued jobs (no filter specified)

Jobs to process: 80+
Type: External ❌ (User wanted Easy Apply only)
Type: External ❌
Type: External ❌
...
```

**User realizes mistake and checks box AFTER job started:**
- Checkbox appears checked ✓
- But job already running with old settings
- Processes all 80+ jobs (both types)
- No way to stop it easily

---

## AFTER (The Fix)

**Page Load (NEW DEFAULT):**
```
☑ Easy Apply only ← Checked by default
☐ External ATS only
☐ Dry run

Active Filter:
✓ Easy Apply jobs only
```

**User clicks Start with default checked:**
```bash
[Automation] Raw state: { easyOnly: true, externalOnly: false, jobId: '', dryRun: false }
[Automation] Setting easy = true
[Automation] Final options being sent: {"easy":true}

[Automation API] Apply options received: {"easy":true}
[Automation API] Adding --easy flag
[Automation API] Final args: ['apply','--easy']

[Apply Command] Options received: {"easy":true}
[Apply Command] Mode: Easy Apply only ✓

Jobs to process: 25
Type: Easy Apply ✓
Type: Easy Apply ✓
Type: Easy Apply ✓
```

---

## If User Wants ALL Jobs

**User unchecks "Easy Apply only":**
```
☐ Easy Apply only
☐ External ATS only
☐ Dry run

Active Filter:
⚠️ No filter - will process ALL queued jobs (both Easy Apply and External)
```

**User clicks Start:**
```
⚠️ WARNING: No filters selected!

This will process ALL queued jobs (both Easy Apply and External).

Are you sure you want to continue?

[Cancel] [OK]
```

**If user clicks OK:**
```bash
[Apply Command] Mode: All queued jobs (no filter specified)
Jobs to process: 80+
```

**If user clicks Cancel:**
```bash
[Automation] User cancelled - no filters selected
(Job does not start)
```
