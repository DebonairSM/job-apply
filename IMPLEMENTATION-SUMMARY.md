# Advanced Job Evaluation - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

The job evaluation system has been upgraded from generic scoring to a sophisticated multi-category weighted scoring system based on your specific technical requirements.

## Key Changes

### 1. Technical Profiles System (`src/ai/profiles.ts`)

Created 6 technical evaluation profiles:

- **Core Azure API Skills (30% weight)** - Azure, APIM, Functions, Service Bus, C#/.NET 6+
- **Security & Governance (20% weight)** - OAuth 2.0, JWT, Entra ID, APIM Policies
- **Event-Driven Architecture (15% weight)** - Service Bus, Event Grid, Integration
- **Performance & Reliability (15% weight)** - Load Testing, Redis, EF Core, Observability
- **DevOps/CI-CD (10% weight)** - Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, Docker, Bicep
- **Seniority & Role Type (10% weight)** - Senior/Lead, Remote

Each profile includes must-have and preferred keywords.

### 2. Boolean Search Strings

Added 6 predefined Boolean searches for LinkedIn:

```bash
--profile core         # Core Azure API Engineer
--profile security     # Security & Governance
--profile event-driven # Event-Driven Architecture
--profile performance  # Performance & Reliability
--profile devops       # DevOps/CI-CD
--profile backend      # Senior Backend .NET (catch-all)
```

These use sophisticated Boolean logic with AND/OR operators to pre-filter jobs on LinkedIn's side before scraping.

### 3. Enhanced Ranking Algorithm (`src/ai/ranker.ts`)

**Before:**
- Generic prompt: "Analyze how well this job matches"
- Single score output
- No breakdown of why score was assigned
- All jobs scoring around 85

**After:**
- Detailed evaluation criteria for each category
- Explicit must-haves vs preferred keywords
- Scoring guidance (e.g., "Score 0 if Azure not mentioned")
- 6 category scores + weighted overall score
- Missing keywords tracking
- Strict evaluation (Python/Java jobs get low scores)

### 4. Enhanced Data Model

**Database Schema:**
- Added `category_scores` column (JSON)
- Added `missing_keywords` column (JSON)
- Migration logic for existing databases

**Validation Schema:**
```typescript
{
  fitScore: number,
  categoryScores: {
    coreAzure: number,
    security: number,
    eventDriven: number,
    performance: number,
    devops: number,
    seniority: number
  },
  reasons: string[],
  mustHaves: string[],
  blockers: string[],
  missingKeywords: string[]
}
```

### 5. Enhanced Console Output

**Search Results:**
```
   1/25 Senior API Engineer at Microsoft
        Score: 92/100
        Azure: 95 | Security: 90 | Events: 85
        Perf: 80 | DevOps: 75 | Senior: 100
        ‚úÖ Queued (Easy Apply)

   2/25 Backend Developer at Example Corp
        Score: 45/100
        Azure: 30 | Security: 40 | Events: 50
        Perf: 60 | DevOps: 40 | Senior: 50
        ‚ö†Ô∏è  Blockers: Primarily Python/Django stack
        ‚ö†Ô∏è  Missing: Azure, APIM, .NET Core
        ‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped (below threshold)
```

**Job List:**
```
üîπ Senior Azure API Engineer
   Company: Microsoft
   Type: Easy Apply
   Rank: 92/100
   Azure: 95 | Security: 90 | Events: 85
   Perf: 80 | DevOps: 75 | Senior: 100
   Status: queued
   Reasons: Strong Azure APIM experience; .NET 8 expertise
```

### 6. CLI Enhancements (`src/cli.ts`)

**New Options:**
```bash
# Use profile-based searches
npx tsx src/cli.ts search --profile core
npx tsx src/cli.ts search --profile security --date week

# Traditional keyword search still works
npx tsx src/cli.ts search "Azure Engineer" --remote
```

**Enhanced List Command:**
- Shows category score breakdowns
- Displays blockers when present
- More detailed job information

## Expected Results

### Score Distribution

**Before:** All jobs scored 80-90
**After:** Jobs will score across full range:
- Perfect matches: 85-95
- Good matches: 70-84
- Moderate matches: 50-69
- Poor matches: 20-49
- Wrong tech stack: 0-19

### Better Filtering

Jobs will be automatically rejected for:
- Wrong programming language (Python, Java, PHP)
- Wrong seniority (Junior, Mid-level)
- Wrong location (On-site only, non-remote)
- Missing critical technologies (no Azure, no .NET)

### Transparency

You can now see exactly why a job scored the way it did:
- Which technical areas are strong matches
- Which areas are weak or missing
- Specific blockers or concerns
- What keywords weren't found in the job description

## Usage Examples

### Profile-Based Search
```bash
# Search for Core Azure API roles posted this week
npx tsx src/cli.ts search --profile core --date week --min-score 75

# Search for Security-focused roles
npx tsx src/cli.ts search --profile security --min-score 80

# Search for DevOps-heavy positions
npx tsx src/cli.ts search --profile devops
```

### Keyword Search (Traditional)
```bash
# Still works as before
npx tsx src/cli.ts search "Senior .NET Azure" --remote --date week
```

### View Results
```bash
# See all queued jobs with category breakdowns
npx tsx src/cli.ts list queued

# Check overall statistics
npx tsx src/cli.ts status
```

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created
- `src/ai/profiles.ts` - Profile definitions and Boolean searches

### Files Modified
- `src/ai/ranker.ts` - Enhanced evaluation prompt with 6 categories
- `src/lib/validation.ts` - Updated schema with categoryScores
- `src/lib/db.ts` - Added database columns with migration
- `src/commands/search.ts` - Profile support, enhanced output
- `src/cli.ts` - New --profile option, enhanced list display
- `README.md` - Documentation updates

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing job records work (new columns are optional)
- Traditional keyword search still works
- Database migration is automatic
- No breaking changes to existing workflows

## Next Steps

1. **Test the new scoring:**
   ```bash
   npx tsx src/cli.ts search --profile core --min-score 70
   ```

2. **Compare with traditional search:**
   ```bash
   npx tsx src/cli.ts search "Azure API Engineer" --remote
   ```

3. **Review category breakdowns:**
   ```bash
   npx tsx src/cli.ts list queued
   ```

4. **Adjust MIN_FIT_SCORE in .env if needed** - You may want to lower it to 60-65 initially since scoring is now more strict.

## Performance Notes

- Boolean searches may return fewer but higher-quality results
- LLM evaluation time is the same (still 2-5 seconds per job)
- Category scoring provides better decision-making data
- Missing keywords help you understand job requirements better
